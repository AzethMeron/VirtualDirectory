# VirtualDirectory - Seamless interface for huge datasets

Simple and universal library, designed to handle datasets stored in multiple subdirectories and with hundreds of thousands of files. Typically used for machine learning, but implementation is versatile enough to support any type of data. Provides seamless interface *(all files appear to be in the same directory)*, reduces number of system calls by loading list of files into memory, allows to *(but does NOT require)* load entire dataset into RAM for quick access.

# Installation

Designed and tested for ```Python 3.12.0```. You can install package using PIP with following command.
